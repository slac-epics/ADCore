This directory contains TIFF and JPEG header files and prebuilt libraries for several OS.

Note that the os/WIN32, os/win32-x86 and os/windows-x64 directories are no
longer being used, because the TIFF and JPEG libraries are being built from
source code on Windows starting in R1-9.  This was done to allow them to be used
when GraphicsMagick is not being used, and prebuilt libraries for 64-bit
Windows are not available on the Web.
